                            Our 11-a-side men’s football team play in the North East Christian Fellowship League on Saturday
                            mornings. The team represents the Methodist Church (we have a close relationship with the
                            Methodist Church having originally developed out of a church youth project) and has been playing in
                            the league since 2008. We also play every year in the National Christian Cup and National Christian
                            Football Festival Weekend. Training takes place weekly.
                            We aim to encourage reflection on life’s meaning and purpose through sharing experience and
                            understanding, bring different people together to learn and understand each other, giving the
                            opportunity to be part of a team especially to those who might not otherwise do so.                        </p>

                            The team provides tournament provides the opportunity to go away to another place for a weekend,
                            meet new people, have new experiences, receive positive messages and participate fully in decision
                            making.
                            As well as providing a positive team framework for young men to take part in regular healthy
                            activities the team is also active in promoting racial and religious harmony. With members from a
                            variety of race and religious backgrounds the team actively raises awareness of discrimination with
                            each other and the teams we play against.

                    and girls of all abilities are welcome as we focus on fun, staying healthy, improving our football skills
                    and building friendships. There is plenty to learn alongside football with fun games, DJ workshops,
                    healthy eating, drumming and it’s a great opportunity to make new friends. We have qualified
                    coaches and an awesome group of staff &amp; volunteers ensuring that everyone has a great experience.

                    Our ethos of welcome and providing an atmosphere where children and young people can be
                    themselves but also learn about and appreciate each other’s differences is appreciated. Feedback
                    from parents suggests that children who might not fit in elsewhere find a place and people they can
                    connect with and want to come back to. We build on these foundations by enabling young
                    volunteers to take on responsibility for delivering the programme and learning new skills.
